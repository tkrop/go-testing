# Usage patterns of testing/mock

This package contains a small extension library to handle mock call setup in a
standardized, highly reusable way. Unfortunately, we had to sacrifice a bit of
type-safety to allow for chaining mock calls in an arbitrary way during setup.
Anyhow, the offered in runtime validation is a sufficient strategy to cover
for the missing type-safty.


## Generic mock setup pattern

To setup a generic mock handler for any number of mocks, one can simply use the
following template to setup an arbitrary system under test.

```go
func SetupTestUnit(
    t *gomock.TestReporter,
    mockSetup mock.SetupFunc,
    ...
) (*Unit, *Mocks) {
    mocks := mock.NewMock(t).Expect(mockSetup)

    unit := NewUnitService(
        mock.Get(mocks, NewServiceMock)
    ).(*Unit)

    return unit, mocks
}
```

**Note:** The `mock.Get(mocks, NewServiceMock)` is the standard pattern to
request an existing or new mock instance from the mock handler.


## Generic mock service call pattern

Now we need to define the mock service calls that follow a primitive, common
coding and naming pattern, that may be supported by code generation in the
future.

```go
func ServiceCall(input..., output..., error) mock.SetupFunc {
    return func(mocks *Mocks) any {
        return mock.Get(mocks, NewServiceMock).EXPECT().
            ServiceCall(input...).Return(output..., error).
			Times(mocks.Times(1)).Do(mocks.GetDone(<#input-args>))
    }
}
```

For simplicity the pattern combines regular as well as error behavior and is
prepared to handle tests with detached *goroutines*, i.e. functions that are
spawned by the system-under-test without waiting for their result.

The mock handler therefore provides a `WaitGroup` and automatically registers
the expected mock calls via `mock.Times(<#>)` and notifies the completion via
`Do(mocks.GetDone(<#input-args>))`. The test needs to wait for the detached
*goroutines* to finish by calling `mocks.Wait()` before checking whether mock
calls are completely consumed.

**Note:** Since waiting for mock calls can take unitl the test timeout appears
in case of test failures, you need to tests using `mocks.Wait()` in an isolated
[test environment](../test) that unlocks the waiting test in case of failures
and fatal errors using:

```go
test.Success(func(t *TestingT) {
    // Given
    ...

    // When
    ...
    mocks.Wait()

    // Then
})
```

A static series of mock service calls can now simply expressed by chaining the
mock service calls as follows using `mock.Chain` and while defining a new mock
call setup function:

```go
func ServiceCallChain(input..., output..., error) mock.SetupFunc {
    return func(mocks *Mocks) any {
        return mock.Chain(
            ServiceCallA(input...),
            ServiceCallB(input...),
            ...
    }
}
```

**Note:** As a special test case it is possible to `panic` as mock a result by
using `Do(mocks.GetPanic(<#input-args>,<reason>))`.


## Generic mock ordering patterns

With the above preparations for mocking service calls we can now define the
*mock setup* easily  using the following ordering methods:

* `Chain` allows to create an ordered chain of mock calls that can be combined
  with other setup methods that defermine the predecessors and successor mock
  calls.

* `Parallel` allows to creates an unordered set of mock calls that can be
  combined with other setup methods that determine the predecessor and
  successor mock calls.

* `Setup` allows to create an unordered detached set of mock calls that creates
  no relation to predecessors and successors it was defined with.

Beside this simple (un-)ordering methods there are two further methods for
completeness, that allow to control how predecessors and successors are used
to setup ordering conditions:

* `Sub` allows to define a sub-set or sub-chain of elements in `Parallel` and
  `Chain` as predecessor and successor context for further combination.

* `Detach` allows to detach an element from the predecessor context (`Head`),
  from the successor context (`Tail`), or from both which is used in `Setup`.

The application of these two functions may be a bit more complex but still
follows the intuition.


## Generic parameterized test pattern

The ordering methods and the mock service call setups can now be used to define
the mock call expectations, in a parameter setup as follows to show the most
common use cases:

```go
var testUnitCallParams = map[string]struct {
    mockSetup    mock.SetupFunc
    input*...    *model.*
    expect       test.Expect
    expect*...   *model.*
    expectError  error
}{
    "single mock setup": {
        mockSetup: ServiceCall(...),
    }
    "chain mock setup": {
        mockSetup: mock.Chain(
            ServiceCallA(...),
            ServiceCallB(...),
            ...
        )
    }
    "nested chain mock setup": {
        mockSetup: mock.Chain(
            ServiceCallA(...),
            mock.Chain(
                ServiceCallA(...),
                ServiceCallB(...),
                ...
            ),
            ServiceCallB(...),
            ...
        )
    }
    "parallel chain mock setup": {
        mockSetup: mock.Parallel(
            ServiceCallA(...),
            mock.Chain(
                ServiceCallB(...),
                ServiceCallC(...),
                ...
            ),
            mock.Chain(
                ServiceCallD(...),
                ServiceCallE(...),
                ...
            ),
            ...
        )
    }
    ...
}
```

This test parameter setup can now be use for all parameterized unit test using
the following common parallel pattern, that includes `mocks.Wait()` to handle
detached *goroutines* as well as the isoated [test environment](../test) to
unlocks the waiting group in case of failures:

```go
func TestUnitCall(t *testing.T) {
    t.Parallel()

for message, param := range testUnitCallParams {
        message, param := message, param
        t.Run(message, test.Expect(param.expect, func(t test.Test) {
            t.Parallel()

            // Given
            unit, mocks := SetupTestUnit(t, param.mockSetup)

            // When
            result, err := unit.UnitCall(param.input*, ...)

            mocks.Wait()

            // Then
            if param.expectError != nil {
                assert.Equal(t, param.expectError, err)
            } else {
                require.NoError(t, err)
            }
            assert.Equal(t, param.expect*, result)
            ...
        }))
    }
}
```
